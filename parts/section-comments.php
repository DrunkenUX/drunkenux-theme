        <summary>Where are the comments?</summary>

        <P>Most comment tools use an unnecessary amount of tracking on users. Simpler solutions require a lot of moderation and spam prevention, while rarely creating truly engaging, valuable discussion. We've made the decision to get rid of our comments sections on the website, and instead encourage you to <a href="https://linktr.ee/drunkenux" title="A list of our social media links">find us where you like having conversations</a> to chat about the content, if you want to share anything with us or others.</p>
